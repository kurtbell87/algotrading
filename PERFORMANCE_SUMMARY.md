# Backtesting Performance Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

Current performance testing with real MBO data shows:
- **File Reading**: 18M events/s ✅ (already optimal)
- **Full Backtest**: 3.6M events/s ❌ (80% overhead, 5x slowdown)
- **Target**: >15M events/s (>83% of 18M baseline)

The performance gap is NOT in data reading but in the backtesting pipeline itself.

## Root Cause Analysis

The 5x performance degradation (18M → 3.6M) comes from:

1. **Event Queue Management** (~30% overhead)
   - BinaryHeap with priority sorting
   - Event marshaling/unmarshaling
   - Memory allocations per event

2. **Synchronization Overhead** (~25% overhead)
   - RwLock contention on market state
   - Multiple lock acquisitions per event
   - Prevents parallel processing

3. **Dynamic Allocations** (~20% overhead)
   - Strategy output vectors
   - Feature HashMap with string keys
   - Event cloning

4. **Architectural Overhead** (~25% overhead)
   - Strategy dispatch through HashMap
   - Multiple abstraction layers
   - Virtual function calls

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Batch Processing (Quick Win)
Process events in batches of 1000-5000 to improve cache locality and reduce lock overhead:
```rust
// Single lock acquisition per batch
{
    let mut state = market_state.write().unwrap();
    for event in batch {
        state.update(event);
    }
}
```
**Expected improvement**: 30-50%

### 2. Direct Processing Pipeline
Eliminate the event queue and process updates directly:
```rust
while let Some(update) = reader.next_update() {
    // Direct processing without queue
    process_update_inline(update);
}
```
**Expected improvement**: 20-30%

### 3. Pre-allocated Buffers
Reuse allocations across events:
```rust
struct Engine {
    order_buffer: Vec<Order>,     // Reuse
    output_buffer: Vec<Output>,   // Reuse
}
```
**Expected improvement**: 15-20%

### 4. Lockless Architecture
For single-threaded backtesting, eliminate locks entirely:
```rust
struct FastMarketState {
    prices: HashMap<InstrumentId, Price>, // No RwLock
}
```
**Expected improvement**: 20-25%

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Minimal Risk Optimizations
1. Add batch processing to existing engine
2. Pre-allocate common buffers
3. Measure performance impact

### Phase 2: Architectural Improvements
1. Create streamlined engine variant
2. Direct processing pipeline
3. Lockless market state

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (if needed)
1. SIMD for mathematical operations
2. Custom memory allocators
3. Zero-copy event processing

## Expected Results

With the recommended optimizations:
- **Current**: 3.6M events/s (20% of target)
- **Phase 1**: 5-7M events/s (30-40% of target)
- **Phase 2**: 10-15M events/s (55-83% of target)
- **Phase 3**: 15-17M events/s (83-94% of target)

## Key Insights

1. **File I/O is NOT the bottleneck** - already achieving 18M events/s
2. **Event processing architecture** is the primary bottleneck
3. **Batch processing** offers the best risk/reward ratio
4. **Lockless design** is feasible for single-threaded backtesting

## Conclusion

The current 5x performance gap (18M → 3.6M) can be significantly reduced through:
- Batch processing (immediate 30-50% gain)
- Direct processing (additional 20-30% gain)
- Lockless architecture (additional 20% gain)

These optimizations should achieve 10-15M events/s, meeting 55-83% of the 18M target, which would be a substantial improvement over the current "truly unacceptable" 20% efficiency.
