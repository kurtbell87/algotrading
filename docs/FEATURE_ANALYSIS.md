# Feature Analysis and Requirements

## Existing Features Summary

The current features module provides a comprehensive set of microstructure features organized into four main categories:

### 1. Book Features (`book_features.rs`)
**Purpose**: Extract features from order book state and MBO events

**Implemented Features**:
- **Spread Metrics**:
  - Absolute spread
  - Relative spread  
  - Spread in basis points
  - Effective spread (volume-weighted)

- **Book Imbalance**:
  - Level 1 imbalance: (bid_vol - ask_vol) / (bid_vol + ask_vol)
  - Multi-level imbalance (placeholder for full book data)
  - Volume-weighted imbalance
  - Micro-price (volume-weighted mid price)

- **Event-Based Pressure**:
  - Arrival pressure (new orders per 100 events)
  - Cancellation pressure
  - Order modification rate

- **Queue Dynamics**:
  - Estimated queue position at best bid/ask
  - Average order lifetime (in events)
  - Order modification rate

### 2. Flow Features (`flow_features.rs`)
**Purpose**: Extract features from order flow and trade patterns

**Implemented Features**:
- **Trade Flow Metrics**:
  - Buy/sell volume in window
  - Flow imbalance: (buy_vol - sell_vol) / total_vol
  - Net flow
  - Trade count and average trade size

- **Aggression Metrics**:
  - Aggressive vs passive volume ratios
  - Buy/sell aggression ratios
  - Overall aggressive ratio

- **Arrival Rate Metrics**:
  - Buy/sell order arrival rates (orders/second)
  - Total arrival rate
  - Average inter-arrival time
  - Arrival rate volatility

- **Trade Size Distribution**:
  - Small/medium/large trade volumes (by percentile)
  - Maximum trade size
  - Trade size standard deviation

### 3. Rolling Features (`rolling_features.rs`)
**Purpose**: Event-based rolling calculations (not time-based)

**Implemented Features**:
- **Multiple Window Types**:
  - Event count windows (last N events)
  - Volume-based windows (last N contracts)
  - Trade count windows (last N trades)
  - Exponential decay windows

- **Calculated Metrics**:
  - VWAP (event-based, volume-based, trade-based)
  - Event-based volatility
  - Simple and exponential moving averages
  - Price ranges (min/max)
  - Momentum (absolute and percentage)

- **Cross-Window Features**:
  - SMA ratios between different event horizons
  - Volatility ratios
  - VWAP comparisons (event vs volume-based)

### 4. Feature Collection (`collector.rs`)
**Purpose**: Efficient storage and retrieval of features

**Capabilities**:
- Circular buffer per instrument
- Consistent feature ordering across samples
- Matrix conversion for ML frameworks
- Time-range queries

## Missing Features for Strategy Implementation

Based on the trading strategies outlined in TRADING_STRATEGIES.md, we need to add:

### 1. Time-Based Features
While the current implementation is event-based (which is good), we also need some time-aware features:

```rust
// src/features/time_features.rs
pub struct TimeFeatures {
    // Session-based features
    time_to_session_close: Duration,
    time_since_session_open: Duration,
    session_volume_percentile: f64,
    
    // Intraday patterns
    time_of_day_bucket: u8,  // 0-23 for hourly buckets
    day_of_week: u8,         // 1-5 for trading days
    
    // Contract roll awareness
    days_to_expiry: i32,
    is_front_month: bool,
    roll_activity_indicator: f64,
}
```

### 2. Advanced Microstructure Features
For high-frequency strategies like OFI:

```rust
// src/features/advanced_book_features.rs
pub struct AdvancedBookFeatures {
    // Order book shape
    book_skew: f64,              // Asymmetry in book depth
    liquidity_imbalance: f64,    // Deep book imbalance
    
    // Price level analysis
    support_resistance_levels: Vec<PriceLevel>,
    distance_to_round_number: f64,
    
    // Hidden liquidity indicators
    iceberg_detection_score: f64,
    dark_pool_indicator: f64,
}
```

### 3. Market Regime Features
For adapting strategies to different market conditions:

```rust
// src/features/regime_features.rs
pub struct RegimeFeatures {
    // Volatility regime
    volatility_percentile: f64,
    volatility_regime: VolatilityRegime,
    
    // Trend indicators
    trend_strength: f64,
    trend_consistency: f64,
    
    // Market efficiency
    autocorrelation: f64,
    hurst_exponent: f64,
}
```

### 4. Execution Quality Features
For market making and execution strategies:

```rust
// src/features/execution_features.rs
pub struct ExecutionFeatures {
    // Fill probability estimates
    fill_probability_bid: f64,
    fill_probability_ask: f64,
    
    // Expected queue time
    expected_queue_time: Duration,
    
    // Adverse selection indicators
    toxic_flow_indicator: f64,
    informed_trader_probability: f64,
}
```

### 5. ML-Ready Feature Transformations
For better ML model performance:

```rust
// src/features/transformations.rs
pub struct FeatureTransformations {
    // Normalization
    z_score_normalize(features: &mut FeatureVector),
    min_max_scale(features: &mut FeatureVector),
    
    // Feature engineering
    polynomial_features(features: &FeatureVector, degree: usize),
    interaction_features(features: &FeatureVector),
    
    // Dimensionality reduction prep
    pca_ready_features(features: &FeatureVector),
}
```

## Implementation Priority

Given the backtesting architecture requirements, prioritize:

1. **High Priority** (Needed for basic strategies):
   - Time-based features (for session awareness)
   - Basic feature transformations (normalization)
   - Integration with backtesting context

2. **Medium Priority** (For advanced strategies):
   - Advanced microstructure features
   - Market regime detection
   - Cross-instrument features (if multiple contracts)

3. **Low Priority** (Nice to have):
   - Execution quality predictions
   - Complex feature engineering
   - Real-time feature validation

## Integration with Backtesting

The existing `FeatureExtractor` needs minor modifications to work with the backtesting system:

```rust
impl FeatureExtractor {
    /// Extract features with backtesting context
    pub fn extract_with_context(
        &mut self, 
        instrument_id: InstrumentId,
        timestamp: u64,
        context: &StrategyContext,
    ) -> FeatureVector {
        let mut features = self.extract_features(instrument_id, timestamp);
        
        // Add context-aware features
        self.add_position_features(&mut features, &context.position);
        self.add_session_features(&mut features, timestamp);
        self.add_risk_features(&mut features, context);
        
        features
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The existing features are well-designed for performance:
- Event-driven updates (no polling)
- Efficient rolling windows
- Pre-allocated buffers

To maintain 18M msg/s throughput:
1. Keep feature calculations simple in hot path
2. Use lazy evaluation where possible
3. Batch feature extraction for ML models
4. Consider feature caching for expensive calculations

## Conclusion

The existing feature infrastructure is solid and performance-oriented. We need to add:
1. Time-awareness for session-based trading
2. Context integration for strategy-aware features
3. Basic transformations for ML readiness

These additions can be implemented without disrupting the existing architecture or performance characteristics.
